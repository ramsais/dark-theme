# Additional Changes to Remove Git Branches from IDE

## Summary of Additional Changes

We've made the following additional changes to completely remove Git branch information from your IDE:

1. **Removed Git mapping from `.idea/vcs.xml`**:
   - The file still contained a Git mapping for your project directory
   - We removed the mapping line: `<mapping directory="$PROJECT_DIR$" vcs="Git" />`
   - This prevents the IDE from associating your project with Git

2. **Removed Git Toolbox configuration file**:
   - Deleted the `.idea/git_toolbox_prj.xml` file
   - This file is created by the Git Toolbox plugin and contains Git-related settings
   - Even with other Git configurations removed, this file can cause branches to still be visible

3. **Updated instructions**:
   - Added steps to check for and remove the Git Toolbox configuration file
   - Added instructions to disable or uninstall the Git Toolbox plugin if installed
   - Updated the explanation of why Git branches might still be visible

## Why You Still See Branches

If you're still seeing Git branches in your IDE after our previous changes, it's likely due to one or more of the following reasons:

1. **Git Toolbox plugin**: This plugin adds Git functionality to the IDE and maintains its own configuration files
2. **Cached Git information**: The IDE might be showing cached Git branch information
3. **IDE hasn't been restarted**: Some changes only take effect after restarting the IDE

## Next Steps

Please follow the updated instructions in the `REMOVE_GIT_BRANCHES_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file to completely remove Git branch information from your IDE. The most important new steps are:

1. Check for and remove the `.idea/git_toolbox_prj.xml` file
2. Consider disabling or uninstalling the Git Toolbox plugin if you don't need it
3. Invalidate caches and restart the IDE

These additional changes should ensure that Git branches are no longer visible in your IDE.
