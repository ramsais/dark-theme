# Instructions to Remove Git Branches from IDE

We've removed all Git-related configurations from your project files. However, IntelliJ IDEA might still be showing Git branches due to cached information. Follow these steps to completely remove Git branch information from your IDE:

## Steps to Clear Git Branch Information

1. **Close the IDE**: First, close IntelliJ IDEA completely.

2. **Delete IDE Caches** (Optional but recommended):
   - Navigate to the IDE system directory:
     - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.IntelliJIdea<version>\system`
     - macOS: `~/Library/Caches/IntelliJIdea<version>`
     - Linux: `~/.cache/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea<version>`
   - Delete the `caches` directory
   - Delete the `index` directory

3. **Restart the IDE**: Open IntelliJ IDEA again.

4. **Verify VCS Settings**:
   - Go to `File > Settings > Version Control` (or `IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences > Version Control` on macOS)
   - Make sure no directories are listed in the "Directory Mappings" section
   - If any directories are listed, select them and click the minus (-) button to remove them

5. **Disable Version Control Integration** (if needed):
   - Go to `File > Settings > Version Control > Directory Mappings`
   - Click the "Enable Version Control Integration" button if it's enabled
   - Select "None" from the dropdown menu and click OK

6. **Remove Git Toolbox Configuration** (if installed):
   - Check if the file `.idea/git_toolbox_prj.xml` exists in your project
   - If it exists, delete this file as it may contain Git branch information
   - This file is created by the Git Toolbox plugin and may cause branches to still appear
   - Consider disabling or uninstalling the Git Toolbox plugin if you don't need it:
     - Go to `File > Settings > Plugins`
     - Find "Git Toolbox" in the installed plugins list
     - Click the gear icon next to it and select "Disable" or "Uninstall"

7. **Invalidate Caches and Restart** (if branches still appear):
   - Go to `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart...`
   - Select "Invalidate and Restart"
   - This will clear all IDE caches and restart the IDE

After following these steps, Git branches should no longer be visible in your IDE. The project is now completely disconnected from any Git repository.

## Why This Happened

Even though you removed the `.git` directory and other Git-related files from your project, IntelliJ IDEA stores Git configuration information in several places:

1. The `.idea/vcs.xml` file (which we've modified)
2. The `.idea/workspace.xml` file (which we've modified)
3. The `.idea/git_toolbox_prj.xml` file (which we've removed)
4. Internal IDE caches

The steps above ensure that all these locations are cleared of Git-related information.
