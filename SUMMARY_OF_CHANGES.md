# Summary of Changes to Remove Git Branches from IDE

## Issue
Even though the `.git` directory and other Git-related files were removed from the project, Git branches were still visible in the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.

## Root Cause
IntelliJ IDEA stores Git configuration information in multiple places:
1. The `.idea/vcs.xml` file
2. The `.idea/workspace.xml` file
3. The `.idea/git_toolbox_prj.xml` file (if Git Toolbox plugin is installed)
4. Internal IDE caches

Even after removing the actual Git repository (`.git` directory), these configuration files still contained references to Git, causing the IDE to display branch information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `.idea/workspace.xml`
Removed the following Git-related components and references:
- `Git.Settings` component
- `GitHubPullRequestSearchHistory` component
- `GithubPullRequestsUISettings` component
- `git-widget-placeholder` property
- `ModuleVcsDetector.initialDetectionPerformed` property
- GitHub settings reference
- `Vcs.Log.Tabs.Properties` component
- `VcsManagerConfiguration` component

### 2. Modified `.idea/vcs.xml`
Removed the Git mapping from the `VcsDirectoryMappings` component:
```xml
<mapping directory="$PROJECT_DIR$" vcs="Git" />
```

### 3. Removed `.idea/git_toolbox_prj.xml`
Deleted the Git Toolbox configuration file that contained Git-related settings for the Git Toolbox plugin. This file can cause Git branches to still be visible in the IDE even after removing other Git configurations.

### 4. Created Instructions
Created a detailed instruction file (`REMOVE_GIT_BRANCHES_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) with steps to completely clear Git branch information from the IDE, including:
- Closing the IDE
- Deleting IDE caches
- Restarting the IDE
- Verifying and adjusting VCS settings
- Invalidating caches if needed

## Next Steps
To completely remove Git branches from the IDE, follow the instructions in the `REMOVE_GIT_BRANCHES_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file. The most important steps are:

1. Restart the IDE to apply the configuration changes we've made
2. Check for and remove the `.idea/git_toolbox_prj.xml` file if it exists
3. If branches are still visible, go to `File > Settings > Version Control` and ensure no directories are mapped to Git
4. If needed, use `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart...` to clear all IDE caches

These changes should ensure that Git branches are no longer visible in the IDE, and the project is completely disconnected from any Git repository.
